- Copy the code from [./min.js](https://github.com/skndash96/jee-scorecard/tree/main/min.js)
- Open Dev tools and Paste the min.js in the console and hit enter.
- Type "allow pasting" if you have to.
- In a few seconds, a black box will appear on the screen which reveals your score. You can copy the output and paste it on a notepad app and review it.
-  You might face an error showing Fetch failed and Keys not found. In that case, wait patiently till the keys are added by me.
